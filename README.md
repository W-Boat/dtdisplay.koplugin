# dtdisplay.koplugin

A [koreader][1] plugin to display the time and day in a fullscreen widget.

## Motivation

E-ink screens make nice ambient displays. I thought it useful to show the time
and date when the device is charging.

Inspired by [clock.koplugin][2] and [kobo-display][3].

## Installation

Clone and copy this repository to the `koreader/plugins` folder.

## Usage

Navigate to `Plugins -> More tools -> Time & Day` to open the widget. Tap
anywhere on the screen to close the widget.

## Testing

Tested with Koreader 2023.03 "Cherry Blossom" on a Kobo Clara 2E and with the
Linux x86 Appimage.
